class(MEDV) =

     -0.1084 * CRIM +
      0.0458 * ZN +
      2.7187 * CHAS=1 +
    -17.376  * NOX +
      3.8016 * RM +

     36.3411

There are 12 terms in the equation.

The positive coefficient means the attribute is in promotion to MEDV.
The negative coefficient means the attribute is inversely proportional to MEDV.
The greater the absolute value of the number, the greater the effect on the resultã€‚

As we can see, in this case  NOX (nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)) can be the most influential attribute.

The INDUS and AGE attributes are dropped out in the equation.
INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940

I think the following reasons can explain this situation: 
	1. Including or excluding of INDUS and AGE attributes won't affect the aim predicting result(MEDV) a lots.(i.e the MEDV rarely depends on AGE and INDUS)
	(i.e these attributes are independent from MEDV)
	2. There might be some data overlaping in the input (not our case)
